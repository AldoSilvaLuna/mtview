NAME
----
	mtview - Multitouch event display tool

SYNOPSIS
--------
	mtview /dev/input/eventX

DESCRIPTION
-----------
mtview captures multitouch events from the specified input devices and
displays them on a graphical window.

DIAGNOSTICS
-----------
If the device is grabbed by another process, mtview will not see any events
(EVIOCGRAB).  This is usually the case when debugging a synaptics or wacom
device from within X. Disabling the device by setting the "Device Enabled"
property on the device is usually sufficient for that driver to drop the
grab.

  xinput set-prop "device name" "Device Enabled" 0
