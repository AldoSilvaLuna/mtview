mtview - Multitouch Viewer

To build, you need to have the autoconf, libtool, xorg-dev,
libutouch-frame-dev, libutouch-evemu-dev and mtdev-dev packages
installed. Then, do

   ./autogen.sh
   ./configure
   make

To view the touch properties of an MT device at /dev/input/eventX, do

   sudo ./tools/mtview /dev/input/eventX

You should be able to see touch events in the window.

To install mtview, do

   sudo make install

By default, mtview installs to /usr/local. To change, use the --prefix
configure option.

Enjoy,
Henrik
